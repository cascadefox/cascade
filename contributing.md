## ✔️ Guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

- PRs should go to the `dev` branch. Reasons:
  - If there is already stuff under development, then it's likely that a conflict may occur.
  - Documentation tends not to be updated by PRs.
  - Testing.
- Use the `.editorconfig` file (located at the root of this project) on your editor so as to "maintain consistent coding styles". For instructions on how to use this file refer to [EditorConfig's website](https://editorconfig.org/).
